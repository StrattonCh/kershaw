Kershaw
================

This repo is for the modeling of the Kershaw baseball data.

The dynamic logit derivations folder contains an R markdown file
detailing how to fit dynamic multinomial regression models using the
Polya-gamma data augmentation strategy. Unfortunately, I never figured
out how to model multiple observation at a single time point, so this
technique was not used to address the time series structure in the
kershaw data.

The hierarchical kershaw model folder contains an R markdown file
detailing how I fit hierarchical regression models to address the time
series structure. The cleaned data are in that folder as well. I did not
push the scraping and cleaning folder since it was too large, but I can
pass that along as a google drive link if you would like.

Finally, my writing project document and presentation are in the writing
project folder.
